# ASS2SRT

This script extracts embedded ssa/ass (SubStationAlpha) subtitles from mkv files and converts them to srt subtitles.

This is useful for players (like many TVs, Roku etc) which can't decode the embedded ass subtitles (especially prevalent in anime) but can display srt subs.

# Usage

`./ass2srt.sh <Directory or filepath>`

# Dependencies
Install mkvmerge (mkvtoolsnix) and ffmpeg prior to running the script
