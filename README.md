# syno-tools

This is a collection of few scripts/configurations/tools for my Synology NAS, although they could be used for almost any linux machine.

A list of various things in here is below.

# flexget

Configuration to track movies added in a watchlist on trakt.tv and then download them automatically when a good enough release is available and send a notification over join.

# syno-dl

A minimal shell script to add downloads to Synology Download station through command line locally or remotely

# ass2srt

A script to extract ass/ssa subtitles embedded in an mkv file (usually anime) and convert them into srt subtitles so that some clients like TVs/Roku etc could display them properly.
